Combine the dal, green chillies, ginger, salt and asafoetida powder and blend into a coarse batter.Place the batter in steamer plates or idli plates and steam on high heat for about 10 minutes until cooked. To check if it is cooked insert a knife in the center and it should come out clean.Remove from the steamer and allow it to cool. Once partially cool, cut into pieces crumble the steamed lentils until there are no lumps.Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan; add the mustard seeds and allow it to crackle. Stir in the crumbled steamed lentils into the seasoning and saute for a few minutes until well combined.Allow the urad dal/ ulundu to cool.

Whisk them together and set aside while you begin to prep for caramelising the sugar.Heat a heavy bottomed pan, add ghee and once it begins to get hot (not smoking), reduce the heat to medium. Add sugar and level it in ghee using a spatula. After five minutes stir the sugar using a spatula (using spatula helps ensure that the caramel won’t stick to it). Keep stirring once in a while till the sugar starts caramelizing as it melts. (The colour of the caramel should not deepen or darken in colour as this will lead to a bitter tasting halwa)Give a quick stir to the flour-semolina batter and slowly add it to the caramelised sugar.Now, starts the tricky part. Hold the wok or pan firmly using a cloth or holder (to avoid the heat) so that you can work your way with the batter. Using ladle (a large heavy spoon/ kalchhul), carefully yet swiftly start mixing the batter into the caramel. The batter will seem to turn lumpy but nothing to worry.Increase the flame to medium and using the back of the spoon keep smashing the batter, especially the whitish lumps, till the whole batter gets completed assimilated and incorporated with the caramel and the halwa wears a homogeneous look.This process will take approximately 3 to 4 minutes. You will also notice that the halwa releases the oil as it begins to come together as evenly toned mixture. At this point, remove excess oil in a small bowl and again roast the halwa for 3 to 4 minutes. Switch off the heat and push the halwa towards the edge of one side of the wok to allow any excess ghee to drain in the centre. Once the ghee leaves the halwa, drain it out in the bowl. Halwa is now ready to be served!Serve Mukhadi Halwa as a dessert after your weekday meal of Dal Makhani, Aloo Ki Sabzi and Phulka.\n",

      "Instructions": "To begin making the Chicken Sausages, Baked Beans and Stir Fried Broccoli Recipe, we will first make the baked beans. Soak the beans overnight for about 8 hours in water.We also have to make the cooked tomato puree. Once the beans are soaked well, our next step is to cook them.  Place the beans in the pressure, place the weight on, cover the pan and cook it along with 2-1/2 cups of water. After 4 to 5 whistles, turn the heat to low and cook for another 15 minutes.Turn off the heat and allow the pressure cooker to release its pressure naturally. This would take another 10 minutes. The beans continue to cook under the pressure even when it is turned off.Once the pressure is released, open the cooker and drain out the excess liquids. You store this liquid and use it in the vegetable stock or risotto.Once the beans are cooked, our next step is to spice it up to make the baked beans.Heat oil in a sauce pan on medium heat; add in the onions and garlic and give it a light sauté until the onions are tender. Add the tomatoes, honey and the spices and give it a stir.Add in the cooked drained beans into the tomato gravy. Stir fry the beans until the beans get well coated with the tomatoes. Cover the pan, turn the heat to low and simmer the beans for about 30 minutes until you noticed the beans are well coated with the spices and tomatoes. Check the salt and seasoning levels and adjust to suit your taste.To Stir fry the BroccoliHeat a sauce pan with oil, add garlic and sauté them till they soften. Add broccoli and season it well with all the seasonings.Sprinkle little water and cook the broccoli for about 5 more minutes till they become quiet tender.

      "TranslatedInstructions": "To begin making the Chicken Sausages, Baked Beans and Stir Fried Broccoli Recipe, we will first make the baked beans. Soak the beans overnight for about 8 hours in water.We also have to make the cooked tomato puree. Once the beans are soaked well, our next step is to cook them.  Place the beans in the pressure, place the weight on, cover the pan and cook it along with 2-1/2 cups of water. After 4 to 5 whistles, turn the heat to low and cook for another 15 minutes.Turn off the heat and allow the pressure cooker to release its pressure naturally. This would take another 10 minutes. The beans continue to cook under the pressure even when it is turned off.Once the pressure is released, open the cooker and drain out the excess liquids. You store this liquid and use it in the vegetable stock or risotto.Once the beans are cooked, our next step is to spice it up to make the baked beans.Heat oil in a sauce pan on medium heat; add in the onions and garlic and give it a light sauté until the onions are tender. Add the tomatoes, honey and the spices and give it a stir.Add in the cooked drained beans into the tomato gravy. Stir fry the beans until the beans get well coated with the tomatoes. Cover the pan, turn the heat to low and simmer the beans for about 30 minutes until you noticed the beans are well coated with the spices and tomatoes. Check the salt and seasoning levels and adjust to suit your taste.To Stir fry the BroccoliHeat a sauce pan with oil, add garlic and sauté them till they soften.

Keep this kaju badam paste aside.The next step is to make a sugar syrup for the ladoos. Bring sugar and water to boil and wait until the sugar syrup reaches 1 string consistency. It is very important to get the sugar syrup to 1 string consistency if you miss this step, the burfi/balls will be not set and harden.Once you have a one string consistency of the sugar syrup, add the cashew almond paste and the cardamon powder. Mix the paste until well combined. Keep flame to medium low and keep stirring the kaju badam mixture continuously.Big bubbles will begin to form and you need to keep mixing constantly, else they will start burning. Keep stirring till the mixture becomes thick. It will take you approximately 30 to 40 minutes until the mixture has thickened and comes away from the sides of the pan and starts looking like a very soft dough.To test, pinch a tiny piece of dough and roll into ball and place it on a plate, if the ball holds it's shape then it is cooked properly, the mixture is ready. If you prefer to cut them into diamonds or square shapes, grease a pan with ghee all over and transfer the dough into the pan and level it even.

      "Instructions": "To begin making the Corn Matar Kachori Recipe, we will first make the dough for the outer crust of the Matar Kachori.In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients for the Kachori dough to form a crumble like texture. Gradually add water into the flour mixture and knead to make a soft and smooth dough.Once all the flour has come together, keep kneading for 3 to 4 minutes so the dough becomes smooth and soft. Cover the dough and keep it aside for 10 minutes till we prepare the filling for the kachori.The next step is to make the filling for the Corn and Matar Kachori.Into a food processor, add all the filling ingredients and pulse to make a coarse mixture. Once the kachori filling is ready, transfer to a bowl, check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.The next step is the roll out the dough and make the Matar Kachoris. You can either shape them as flat breads or keep it as a ball, its a personal choice.And to cook the Kachori's you can either use an Air Fryer, Bake in an Oven or Deep Fry them. I have tried all the methods and my favorite has been with the Air Fryer. The best part about using the Air Fryer is, I was able to pre-make these Kachoris in the Air Fryer and reheat it in the Air Fryer to make it crisp again.Divide the dough into 12 to 15 equal portions and roll out each dough into 2 inch diameter circles.Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of the rolled out dough. Bring all the sides of the dough together to seal the filling. Twist the dough to seal the Corn Matar Kachori well. When you bring the dough you might find some excess dough collected on the top, remove this dough.Proceed to make the remaining Matar Kachoris the similar way.You can either choose to keep the Kachori like a ball or roll the Kachori gently to make a 3 inch diameter circle. Take care when you roll, as the filling might spill out.If you are using the Air Fryer or the Oven, then preheat them at 180 C for about 15 minutes. Place the Kachoris in the Air Fryer Basket or the Baking sheet (for the oven) and bake until the Kachoris are golden brown and crisp on all sides.If you plan to deep fry them, then preheat the oil for deep frying. Once the oil is heated, fry the Kachoris on low to medium heat until you get a deep golden brown color and it is crisp. Once golden, drain on absorbent paper and proceed to make the remaining Kachoris the similar way.Serve these mouth watering Corn and Matar Kachoris as a tea time or evening snack along with Green Chutney and Date Chutney.
